# ATPbindingEnsemble
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) serves as a central energy currency and signaling molecule in cellular processes, with ATP-binding sites in proteins playing critical roles in enzymatic catalysis, signal transduction, and gene regulation. Accurate identification of ATP-binding sites is essential for understanding protein function mechanisms and facilitating drug discovery, enzyme engineering, and disease pathway analysis. In this study, we present a novel hybrid deep learning framework that synergizes heterogeneous learning paradigms based on protein sequence information for accurate ATP-binding site prediction. Our approach integrates two complementary base classifiers. One is a Transformer-based model, which leverages high-level contextual embeddings generated by ESM2 (Evolutionary Scale Modeling 2), a state-of-the-art protein language model, combined with a local-global dual-attention mechanism that enables the model to simultaneously characterize short-segment and long-range contextual dependencies across the entire protein sequence. The other is a deep Q-network (DQN)-inspired classifier that achieves residue-level prediction as a sequential decision-making process. The final predictions are generated through a weighted ensemble strategy, where optimal weights are determined via cross-validations to leverage the strengths of both models. The prediction results on benchmark independent testing sets indicate that our method achieves satisfactory performance on key metrics. The research in this work offers a deeper understanding of protein-ligand recognition mechanisms and supportive efforts on large-scale functional annotation that critical for system biology and drug target discovery.
